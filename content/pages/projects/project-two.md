Using **real-time sensors** and **AI-based crash detection**, it automatically sends distress signals to emergency contacts and authorities in case of an accident. Designed for **seamless integration with modern mobility**, Raptor ensures swift response times and improved road safety.

# Raptor – Smart Helmet with Accident Detection & Emergency Alert

Raptor is an **AI-powered smart helmet** designed to enhance rider safety through real-time accident detection and emergency alert systems. The helmet integrates IoT sensors, AI-based crash detection, and automated emergency response mechanisms to ensure immediate assistance in case of an accident.
With the rising number of road accidents involving two-wheelers, many riders fail to receive timely medical attention, leading to severe consequences. Raptor aims to solve this by automatically detecting crashes and alerting emergency contacts with real-time location details.

## Project Motivation

Road safety is a critical issue worldwide, especially for motorcyclists. While conventional helmets provide physical protection, they lack smart features to assist riders in emergencies.

Raptor goes beyond traditional helmet designs by integrating AI-driven crash detection and real-time communication to save lives.

### Key Features & Implementation

#### 1. AI-Based Crash Detection System

Accelerometer & Gyroscope Sensors detect sudden impact, abrupt motion changes, and helmet tilt angles, determining if a crash has occurred.
AI algorithms analyze sensor data to distinguish between a normal fall and a severe accident.
The system prevents false alarms by using ML models trained on real-world riding data.

#### 2. Emergency Alert & Live Location Sharing

Upon detecting an accident, Raptor automatically sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts.
The alert includes the rider’s live GPS location, allowing responders to reach the accident site quickly.
Uses ESP-32 module for real-time location tracking, even in low-connectivity areas.

#### 3. Fall & Unconsciousness Detection

If a rider falls but doesn’t move for a certain period, the system assumes unconsciousness and triggers emergency alerts.
Integrated pulse sensor & body temperature monitor can detect abnormal rider conditions.

4\. Smart Helmet Lock System (Prevention Feature)
The helmet has an ignition-locking mechanism, ensuring the bike won’t start unless the helmet is worn.
Uses RFID/NFC authentication for secure user verification before ignition.

#### 5. Mobile App Integration for Alerts & Tracking

The helmet connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth, allowing riders to:
       View ride analytics & helmet status.
       Receive battery & sensor health alerts.
       Customize emergency contact details.
The app is designed with a clean, user-friendly UI, ensuring easy navigation and real-time monitoring.

#### 6. Voice Assistance & Hands-Free Communication

Built-in Bluetooth speakers & microphone allow for hands-free calls and navigation assistance.
AI voice commands enable riders to control features without distraction.

### Challenges & Solutions

Accurate Crash Detection: Implemented AI-driven pattern recognition to reduce false positives.
Ensuring Instant Emergency Response: Optimized GPS & GSM module for fast and reliable connectivity.
User Comfort & Battery Life: Used a lightweight battery pack with optimized power consumption, ensuring long-lasting operation without adding extra weight.

### Expected Impact & Real-World Application

Increases rider safety by ensuring quick medical response.
Prevents unauthorized ignition through helmet authentication.
Reduces accident fatalities by leveraging AI for faster emergency assistance.

### Tech Stack & Tools Used

Hardware: ESP32, MPU6050 (Accelerometer & Gyroscope), RFID/NFC Sensor, Pulse Sensor.
Software: C (for AI crash detection algorithms).
Database & Cloud: Firebase for real-time alerts & Supa base for emergency logs.

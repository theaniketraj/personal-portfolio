\###### \*\*TL;DR –\*\* 🚀🏍️
Raptor is a \*\*smart helmet\*\* equipped with \*\*accident detection\*\* and an \*\*emergency alert system\*\* to enhance rider safety. Using \*\*real-time sensors and AI-based crash detection\*\*, it automatically sends distress signals to emergency contacts and authorities in case of an accident. Designed for \*\*seamless integration with modern mobility\*\*, Raptor ensures swift response times and improved road safety.
\### \*\*Raptor – Smart Helmet with Accident Detection & Emergency Alert\*\*
\*\*Raptor\*\* is an \*\*AI-powered smart helmet\*\* designed to enhance \*\*rider safety through real-time accident detection and emergency alert systems\*\*. The helmet integrates \*\*IoT sensors, AI-based crash detection, and automated emergency response mechanisms\*\* to ensure immediate assistance in case of an accident.
With the rising number of road accidents involving two-wheelers, many riders \*\*fail to receive timely medical attention\*\*, leading to severe consequences. \*\*Raptor aims to solve this by automatically detecting crashes and alerting emergency contacts with real-time location details\*\*.
\### \*\*Project Motivation\*\*
Road safety is a \*\*critical issue worldwide\*\*, especially for motorcyclists. While conventional helmets provide physical protection, \*\*they lack smart features to assist riders in emergencies\*\*. \*\*Raptor goes beyond traditional helmet designs by integrating AI-driven crash detection and real-time communication to save lives.\*\*
\### \*\*Key Features & Implementation\*\*
\#### \*\*1. AI-Based Crash Detection System\*\*
\*   \*\*Accelerometer & Gyroscope Sensors\*\* detect \*\*sudden impact, abrupt motion changes, and helmet tilt angles\*\*, determining if a crash has occurred.
\*   AI algorithms \*\*analyze sensor data\*\* to distinguish between a normal fall and a \*\*severe accident\*\*.
\*   The system prevents false alarms by using \*\*ML models trained on real-world riding data\*\*.
\#### \*\*2. Emergency Alert & Live Location Sharing\*\*
\*   Upon detecting an accident, \*\*Raptor automatically sends an SOS alert\*\* to emergency contacts.
\*   The \*\*alert includes the rider’s live GPS location\*\*, allowing responders to reach the accident site quickly.
\*   Uses \*\*ESP-32 module\*\* for real-time location tracking, even in low-connectivity areas.
\#### \*\*3. Fall & Unconsciousness Detection\*\*
\*   If a rider \*\*falls but doesn’t move for a certain period\*\*, the system assumes unconsciousness and triggers emergency alerts.
\*   Integrated \*\*pulse sensor & body temperature monitor\*\* can detect abnormal rider conditions.
\#### \*\*4. Smart Helmet Lock System (Prevention Feature)\*\*
\*   The helmet has an \*\*ignition-locking mechanism\*\*, ensuring the bike won’t start unless the helmet is worn.
\*   Uses \*\*RFID/NFC authentication\*\* for \*\*secure user verification\*\* before ignition.
\#### \*\*5. Mobile App Integration for Alerts & Tracking\*\*
\*   The helmet connects to a \*\*mobile app via Bluetooth\*\*, allowing riders to:
    \*   View ride analytics & helmet status.
    \*   Receive \*\*battery & sensor health alerts\*\*.
    \*   Customize emergency contact details.
\*   The app is designed with a \*\*clean, user-friendly UI\*\*, ensuring easy navigation and real-time monitoring.
\#### \*\*6. Voice Assistance & Hands-Free Communication\*\*
\*   Built-in \*\*Bluetooth speakers & microphone\*\* allow for hands-free calls and navigation assistance.
\*   \*\*AI voice commands\*\* enable riders to control features without distraction.
\### \*\*Challenges & Solutions\*\*
\*   \*\*Accurate Crash Detection:\*\* Implemented \*\*AI-driven pattern recognition\*\* to reduce false positives.
\*   \*\*Ensuring Instant Emergency Response:\*\* Optimized GPS & GSM module for \*\*fast and reliable connectivity\*\*.
\*   \*\*User Comfort & Battery Life:\*\* Used a \*\*lightweight battery pack with optimized power consumption\*\*, ensuring long-lasting operation without adding extra weight.
\### \*\*Expected Impact & Real-World Application\*\*
\*   \*\*Increases rider safety\*\* by ensuring quick medical response.
\*   \*\*Prevents unauthorized ignition\*\* through helmet authentication.
\*   \*\*Reduces accident fatalities\*\* by leveraging AI for faster emergency assistance.
\### \*\*Tech Stack & Tools Used\*\*
\*   \*\*Hardware:\*\* \*\*ESP32\*\*, \*\*MPU6050\*\* (Accelerometer & Gyroscope), \*\*RFID/NFC\*\* Sensor, \*\*Pulse\*\* Sensor.
\*   \*\*Software:\*\* \*\*C\*\* (for AI crash detection algorithms).
\*   \*\*Database & Cloud:\*\* \*\*Firebase\*\* for real-time alerts & \*\*Supa base\*\* for emergency logs.
